# BlazorApp
I want to make websites in the future. I also know that C# is a very useful language. So I tried out Blazor which is a workframe that allows me to write every aspect of a website but only using C# instead of learning three other languages at once.

I made a calculator web app using Blazor. I open the app through Visual Studio 2022 where I have my project stored there. I select the play button and then it creates the website in a new tab. As I work on it I am able to easily click a fire button and it commits the changes to my web pages.


I chose to make a calculator because they are simple to program and it allowed me to understand and learn more about how to manipulate the backend and front end look of my web pages.

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}
I manually created the code to make the calculator. I did not write the majority of the project creating any of the files besides the few I worked on specifically to make the calculator and the main page code. I did already have code to make an incrementor button provided for me. Using this provided Code as well as looking on the internet and finding something that greatly helped me on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70094020/blazor-click-calculator I was able to manipulate it into the calculator you see on the website.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Switch from a button based calculator to entering numbers in a text box through typing.
* Provide a division button.
* Update the main page to have pictures of my hobbies and future products I wish to sell.
*I have a few excess files I no longer need I must get rid of: Index1.cshtml and Error.cshtml.cs (Assuming the final one is the file I tried getting rid of earlier but somehow did not delete how I expected it to.
